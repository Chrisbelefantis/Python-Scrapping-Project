# Overview
The reason for this project was a university assignment in which we had to write a script that plots data about tourists in Greece
during the period 2011-2015. So every time the excel files were the same and there was no need for scraping the webpage. At the version 
that I created **the range of years is selected from the user** so the program parses the HTML code and its looking for the links of the correct
excel files. You can find the data used in this project [here](https://www.statistics.gr/el/statistics/-/publication/STO04/2015-Q4) .

>The available data only allows ranges from 2010 to 2015.
